    "respuesta": "The hypothesis is not consistent with the premise.\n\nIn the premise, \"Whole Life Policies\" are defined as:\n\n- Policies that provide insurance over the insured'...\n\n\nThis definition specifically highlights the fact that Whole Life Policies pay out upon death of the insured, regardless of how long they live after purchasing the policy.\n\nOn the other hand, in the hypothesis, \"Whole life policies are a type of life insurance that only cover the insured person until retirement from the workforce.\" , it is stated that Whole Life Policies are specifically a type of life insurance that pays out upon death of the insured, but only until retirement from the workforce. In this statement, it is explicitly mentioned that the payment upon death of the insured does not continue after retirement from the workforce.\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis is not consistent with the premise, as the latter defines Whole Life Policies as specifically a type of life insurance that pays out upon death of the insured, but only until retirement from the workforce.",
