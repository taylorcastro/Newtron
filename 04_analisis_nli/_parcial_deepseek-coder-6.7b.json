Here's a sample solution using these libraries:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef get_iata_code(airport):\n    url = \"https://www.icao.int/public/consol/eurocontrol-airport-codes/\"\n    \n    # Send a GET request to the website and parse the response content with BeautifulSoup\n    r = requests.get(url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')\n\n    # Find table rows containing airport data\n    rows = soup.find_all('tr', {'class':'even'}) + soup.find_all('tr', {'class':'odd'})\n    \n    for row in rows:\n        # The fourth column contains the airport name and IATA code\n        columns = row.find_all('td')\n        \n        if len(columns) > 3 and airport.lower() == columns[2].text.lower():\n            return columns[3].text.strip()\n    \n    return \"Not found\"\n\nprint(get_iata_code(\"Broumov Airport\"))\n```\nPlease replace `'https://www.icao.int/public/consol/eurocontrol-airport-codes/'` with the actual URL of the webpage containing airport data. This code snippet sends a GET request to that URL, parses HTML content returned by server using BeautifulSoup library, finds all rows in the table (which contain airport data) and checks if airport name matches the given one. If it does, function returns IATA code from the corresponding column; otherwise, it returns \"Not found\".\n\nPlease note that this solution may not work as expected if website structure changes or if the webpage contains JavaScript heavy content loaded after initial HTML load. For those cases more advanced tools like Selenium WebDriver might be necessary. Also keep in mind to always respect the rules of using data from external websites and to check terms and conditions before scraping any data.\n",

In terms of material used, many ROP technologies use composite materials like carbon fiber or nylon because they are strong and lightweight enough to be built into the aircraft structure.
